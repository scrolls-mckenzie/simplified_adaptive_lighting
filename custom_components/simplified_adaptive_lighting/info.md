# Simplified Adaptive Lighting

A streamlined adaptive lighting integration for Home Assistant that automatically adjusts light brightness and color temperature based on time of day.

## Features

- **Seamless Integration**: Works with any control source (Home Assistant UI, HomeKit, automations, etc.)
- **HomeKit Compatible**: Adaptive light entities can be shared to HomeKit through Homebridge
- **Per-Light Configuration**: Individual white balance and brightness adjustments for each light
- **Time-Based Adaptation**: Automatic brightness and color temperature adjustments throughout the day
- **Simple Setup**: Easy configuration through Home Assistant's UI

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in your Home Assistant instance
2. Go to "Integrations"
3. Click the "+" button in the bottom right
4. Search for "Simplified Adaptive Lighting"
5. Click "Download"
6. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from GitHub
2. Copy the `simplified_adaptive_lighting` folder to your `custom_components` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

1. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for "Simplified Adaptive Lighting"
4. Follow the configuration wizard:
   - Enter a name for your adaptive lighting setup
   - Select the lights you want to control
   - Adjust white balance settings for each light (optional)

## Usage

Once configured, the integration creates a switch entity that controls adaptive lighting:

- **Turn On**: Enables adaptive lighting for selected lights
- **Turn Off**: Disables adaptive lighting (lights work normally)

When adaptive lighting is enabled:
- Lights automatically adjust brightness and color temperature when turned on
- Settings are applied regardless of how lights are controlled (UI, voice, automation)
- Each light uses its individual white balance corrections

## White Balance Adjustment

Different light manufacturers may have slightly different color temperatures. Use the white balance offset to make all your lights appear consistent:

- **Positive values**: Make lights cooler (more blue)
- **Negative values**: Make lights warmer (more yellow)
- **Range**: -1000K to +1000K

## Brightness Factor

Adjust the overall brightness level for individual lights:

- **Values > 1.0**: Make lights brighter
- **Values < 1.0**: Make lights dimmer
- **Range**: 0.1x to 2.0x

## HomeKit Integration

The adaptive light entities created by this integration are fully compatible with HomeKit through Homebridge:

### Setup with Homebridge

1. Install the [Homebridge Home Assistant plugin](https://github.com/home-assistant/homebridge-homeassistant)
2. Configure the plugin to include your adaptive light entities
3. In your Homebridge configuration, add the adaptive light entities to the `include_entities` list:

```json
{
  "platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "HomeAssistant",
      "host": "http://your-ha-ip:8123",
      "access_token": "your-long-lived-access-token",
      "include_entities": [
        "light.adaptive_living_room_light",
        "light.adaptive_bedroom_light"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### HomeKit Behavior

When controlling adaptive lights through HomeKit:

- **Brightness Control**: Works normally - you can adjust brightness from 0-100%
- **Color Temperature**: Automatically calculated based on time of day
- **On/Off**: Standard HomeKit light controls work as expected
- **Scenes**: HomeKit scenes will work with brightness settings, color temperature adapts automatically

### Benefits for HomeKit Users

- **Consistent Experience**: All lights adapt automatically regardless of control method
- **No Manual Adjustment**: Color temperature adjusts throughout the day without user intervention
- **HomeKit Automation**: Use HomeKit automations with brightness while color temperature adapts
- **Siri Control**: "Hey Siri, turn on the living room light" applies adaptive color temperature automatically

### Troubleshooting HomeKit Integration

If adaptive lights don't appear in HomeKit:

1. Ensure the entities are included in your Homebridge configuration
2. Restart Homebridge after configuration changes
3. Check that the adaptive light entities are available in Home Assistant
4. Verify the Homebridge Home Assistant plugin is properly authenticated

## Troubleshooting

### Lights Not Responding to Adaptive Settings

1. Ensure the lights are selected in the integration configuration
2. Verify the adaptive lighting switch is turned on
3. Check that lights support both brightness and color temperature control

### Integration Not Appearing

1. Ensure you've restarted Home Assistant after installation
2. Check the Home Assistant logs for any error messages
3. Verify the integration files are in the correct directory

### Performance Issues

The integration is designed to add minimal latency (< 100ms) to light commands. If you experience delays:

1. Check your Home Assistant system resources
2. Reduce the number of lights under adaptive control
3. Check for conflicts with other lighting integrations
